This project is "Flash Meal" (make a meal under 15 minutes)

My idea of this project is I would like to have some place that everyone can come an upload or share their recipes of their dish that can cook under 15 -30 mins . The reason I came up with this idea because I like to cook and sometimes I'm in a rush (time is valuable). This app is for everyone that would like fast food but homemade.  Person that use this app can be everyone since a beginner or intermediate level of cooking skill
